### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Aidan and I am from the Bay Area, California. I have been studying the Master degree of Software Development at Boston University since March, 2020 and have taken Data Sturcture with Python, Algorithms with Java, and Front-end Development with html/CSS/Vue. The Master of Software Devlopment has taught me the foundanmental concepts of computer science, and through self exploring, I am inspired by the virtual applications and I am determined to pursue my career in software development.
