## Hi, my name is Aidan
#### Master's Student in Software Development at Boston University
\
I live in the Bay Area, California, and I have been studying for a Master's degree in Software Development at Boston University since March 2020. I have taken and passed the courses in Data Structures and Algorithms with Python and Java, and Front-end Development with HTML/CSS/JS/Vue with an average GPA of 3.2. The Master's of Software Development has taught me the fundamental concepts of computer science, and I am intrigued by the computor languages! I am excited to learn more skills and knowledge, and I am determined to pursue my career in the software industry.
