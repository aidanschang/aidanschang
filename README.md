## Hi, my name is Aidan
#### Master's Student in Software Development at Boston University
\
I currently live in the Bay Area, California, and I have been studying for a Master's degree in Software Development at Boston University since March 2020. I have taken courses such as: Data Structures with Python, Algorithms with Java, and Front-end Development with HTML/CSS/JS/Vue. By far my favorite class is the Data Structures and Algorithms because I enjoying learning and writing computer languages while understanding how computer works! The Master of Software Development has taught me the fundamental concepts of computer science, and through self-exploring, I am inspired by the virtual applications and I am determined to pursue my career in software development.
